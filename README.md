<h3> Project4 </h3>

prj4-sol.hs
A file which contains the specifications for the functions.

Unit.hs
This file provides a crude implementation of assertions for unit tests, without needing to download external dependencies.

The project can be run from within ghci:

-- start GHC REPL
$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.8.4: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

-- initial load of file
Prelude> :l "prj4-sol.hs"
[1 of 2] Compiling Unit             ( Unit.hs, interpreted )
[2 of 2] Compiling Main             ( prj4-sol.hs, interpreted )
Ok, two modules loaded.

-- Running all the tests.
Prelude> testAll
